Mindstorms Lab #4 There are many known algorithms to solve a maze. For this lab, we will use the right-hand algorithm to solve a maze. The fundamental instruction in this algorithm is to follow the wall to the right and go through any opening on that side. This works for the mazes without tunnels or bridges with start and end points at the outer edges of the maze. The following shows and example of this algorithm. Write a program for Mindstorms robot to solve an example maze to solve using the ultrasonic sensors. Components required: Mindstrom controller, DC motor setup, 2 ultrasonic/infrared sensors or one infrared/ultrasonic and one touch sensor Assumptions: FC – Front Closed FO – Front Open RC – Right Closed RO – Right Open 1. (FO,RC) – Straight 2. (FC,RO) – Right 3. (FC,RC) – Right , (FO,RO) – Right 5. (FO,RO) – Right
